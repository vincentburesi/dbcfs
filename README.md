# DBCFS

Discord Bot Controlled Factorio Server is an all integrated, docker-embedded system that aims at setting up a server managable by people without any technical knowledge through discord messages and some simple http pages.
This repository is only a POC (proof of concept) and will serve as a base to prove the whole system viability.

## How to start the server

- Make sure Docker is installed on the machine
- Write the configuration file: `src/main/resources/application.yml` (you can use the example file in the same folder as base)
- You can start the server using the `run.sh` file

## Features TODO list

Big refactor incoming to prepare the project for public release.
